##  Directory: 0x00-html_advanced

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

In this project, we dive deep into HTML5 to learn how to **structure** web pages using **semantic tags** and proper hierarchy â€” no CSS or design involved yet.

We'll build a basic webpage structure for **Techium**, a fictional company, and gradually add content using only HTML.

This is the first step in mastering web development through the **Web Stack specialization**.

##  Concepts Covered

- HTML syntax and best practices
- Semantic elements and document structure
- Lists (ordered and unordered)

- Embedding audio, video, and external content
- Creating accessible, structured HTML documents
- Tables and data structuring
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Use of `<div>` vs `<span>`
- Tags like: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, etc.

##  Notes

- The goal is structure, not style â€” donâ€™t worry if the pages look plain!
- Techium is the sample company name used across all pages
- Strict naming and formatting are **critical** to pass auto-checkers
