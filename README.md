## Concepts

For this project, you should understand the following concept:

- **HTML - elements of a web page**

---

##  Welcome!

Welcome to the **Web Stack Specialization!**  
The first three projects will teach you the basics of web development: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Developer Tools**.

In this project, you'll focus on using **HTML tags** to structure a web page.  
No CSS, no styling — the final page might look "ugly" and that’s completely fine. The goal is to understand structure, not design.

 **Important:**  
Be extremely careful with spelling, capitalization, and syntax. Even a small typo can break your code or make it fail validation.
